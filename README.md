Homework assignment one code refractor consisted on refracting a premade htmll file with attached css file. what I did to complete this assignment, was as followed:
* In the index.html file, i corrected and added a few semantic element tags for example:
* I renoved a couple of <div> tags and replaced them with their appropriate tags corresponding to their location
* I added a few new classes to the html file
* i consolidaded and corrected the css file so that it flows better and is less cluttered
